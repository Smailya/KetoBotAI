 MoodAnalyser

I developed a MoodAnalyser which is a simple Python tool that leverages TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis on text input. By analyzing the sentiment polarity, the tool returns a corresponding emoji to represent the mood. Itâ€™s an easy-to-use utility for quickly gauging the sentiment of text data.
 Features
- Sentiment analysis using TextBlob
- Dataclass implementation for structured data
- Emoji-based mood representation
- Configurable sentiment threshold

 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TextBlob

 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required libraries:


    pip install textblob

3. Run the script:

    python sentiment_cript.py

 Usage
- Run the script in your terminal and input any text to analyze its sentiment.
- The tool will return an emoji representing the sentiment along with its polarity score.

 Example
Text: I love this!
